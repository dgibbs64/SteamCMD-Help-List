-- Building Steam Applications --

Full documentation of this process is beyond the scope of this little 'help'
system, and so it is provided as part of the Steam SDK.

If you are a licensed Steam Application Developer, then you will be using
this tool to 'build' your game or application and create update patches in
the Steam system. In that case, the 'app_build' command is the one you're
looking for.
