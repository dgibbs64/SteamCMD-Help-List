-- Console Variables --

ConVars are variables used to set options and program behavior. Often, but
not always, Steam client ConVars are named beginning with the '@' character.
The '@' character is simply part of their name, it is not a directive
itself.

To see the current value of a ConVar, simply type its name into the console
and hit enter. To change the value, type the name of the ConVar followed by
the desired value, and hit enter.
